Cultural landscapes represent the \"combined\\n                works of nature and of man\" designated in Article 1 of\\n                the Convention.  They are illustrative of the evolution\\n                of human society and settlement over time, under the\\n                influence of the physical constraints and/or\\n                opportunities presented by their natural environment and\\n                of successive social, economic and cultural forces, both\\n                external and internal.

Protection of cultural\\n                landscapes can contribute to modern techniques of\\n                sustainable land-use and can maintain or enhance natural\\n                values in the landscape.  The continued existence of\\n                traditional forms of land-use supports biological\\n                diversity in many regions of the world.
